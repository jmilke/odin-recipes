    <h2>Description</h2>
    “Come along in, and have some tea!” he managed to say after taking a deep breath.
    “A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,” said Balin with the white 
    beard. “But I don't mind some cake-seed-cake, if you have any.”
    “Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to 
    the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to the pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he 
    had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel.
